                                    If the educational expense exceeds the tax-exempt cap, you have the option to settle
                                    the total expense through the SmartFunder platform or utilise only the tax-exempt
                                    portion and personally settle the balance with the institution.
                                    For example, if your school fees for a Grade 7 learner is R26 000 per year, you can
                                    settle the full R26 000 (scenario 1) from your payroll using the SmartFunder
                                    platform. Alternatively, you can choose to only utilise the non-taxable portion of
                                    R20 000 and personally settle the remaining balance of R6 000 (scenario 2). The tax
                                    saving will be the same in both scenarios:

                                    Most schools and tertiary educational institutions are pre-loaded onto the
                                    SmartFunder platform. You can select the relevant institution when you register your
                                    relative.

                                    situated. Start your search with the actual name of the institution. For example,
                                    when searching for “Florida High School”, start your search with “Florida”. When
                                    searching for tertiary educational institutions, use the full name and not the
                                    abbreviation. For example, start your search with “Pretoria” if you are searching
                                    for the “University of Pretoria” or “South Africa” when you are searching for
                                    “UNISA” (University of South Africa).
                                    If the institution is not on our list, select the “Recommend an Educational
                                    Institution” button and add the required details to enable SmartFunder to verify the

                                    for payments towards the school. The term will start from the end of January until
                                    end of October or November. For tertiary education, we offer a 6-, 7-, 10- or
                                    11-month payment term. The payment terms will be adjusted accordingly when
                                    registering later in the year, taking into account the month of registration, and
                                    the last instalment will always remain either October or November (depending on the

                                <p> Every month, SmartFunder will provide the Employer with a payroll adjustment file,
                                    on a date as specified by the Employer. This file pulls into the Employer’s payroll
                                    software, in the exact same manner as a medical aid contribution file. The employer
                                    only needs to import this file into their software and make one bulk payment for the
                                    total fees amount to SmartFunder.

                                <p> There is not cost! SmartFunder aims to provide this to employers at a budget neutral
                                    level, thereby offering a fantastic benefit to employees, at no additional cost to
                                    the employer.

                                <p> SmartFunder charges an administration fee for each beneficiary for whom we process
                                    payments. This is not a set fee, instead it is a sliding scale, based on an
                                    employee’s CTC. An employer has the choice to either pay this admin fee on behalf of
                                    the employee, or to have the employee pay the admin fee.

                                    However, we do require a minimum total monthly admin fee of R3000 per employer. If
                                    the total admin fees of all employees are less than R3000, an employer will only be
                                    liable for the shortfall.

                                <p> Yes, fees processed through SmartFunder decreases an employer’s Total Leviable
                                    Amount. An employer’s Skills Development Levy and Skills Development Target are
                                    linked to their leviable amount. A decrease in Total Leviable Amount would therefore
                                    have a direct impact on an employer’s levy and target.

                                    vetting around applications right through to the distribution of school fees. All
                                    that is left for you as employer to do is a simple payroll adjustment and a single
                                    third-party payment.

                                    is no longer employed at the company, no deduction will be made and subsequently no
                                    payment to the school for this specific employee. The individual would now be
                                    responsible for making the payments, as they did before they made use of
                                    SmartFunder.
